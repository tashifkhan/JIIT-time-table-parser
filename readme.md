This is a Flask-based web application that simplifies the process of creating and managing time tables. The application allows users to upload their time table files in various formats (CSV, XLSX, XLS, PDF) and generates a simplified schedule (you can download it too). Additionally, it provides an option to select electives and integrates with Google Calendar to add events.

## Features

- Upload time table files in CSV, XLSX, XLS, or PDF formats.
- Automatically parse and convert the uploaded files to a simplified schedule.
- Select electives and generate a personalized time table.
- Integrate with Google Calendar to add events.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tashifkhan/JIIT-time-table-parser
   cd JIIT-time-table-parser
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up Google Calendar API credentials:
   - Follow the instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python) to create credentials and download the `credentials.json` file.
   - Place the `credentials.json` file in the root directory of the project.

## Usage
